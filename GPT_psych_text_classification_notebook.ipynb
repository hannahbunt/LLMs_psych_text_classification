        "I want to teach you how to do a 'reported speech analysis' on diary entries. Reported speech is how we represent the speech of other people or what we ourselves say. There are two main types of reported speech: direct speech and indirect speech.\n",
        "Direct speech repeats the exact words the person used, or how we remember their words.\n",
        "Indirect speech reports the original speaker’s words are changed. Indirect speech focuses more on the content of what someone said rather than their exact words.\n",
        "Speech reports consist of two parts: the reporting clause and the reported clause. The reporting clause includes a verb such as 'say', 'tell', 'ask', 'reply', 'shout', 'assert', 'whisper', 'write', 'type'. The reported clause includes what the original speaker said.\n",
        "Sometimes, objects are metaphorically used when someone says or has said something. This is metonymy and should also be considered 'reported speech'.\n",
